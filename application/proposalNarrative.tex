% (v) an explanation of how the adaptive course meet or exceeds
% mastery requirements and learning outcomes for a similar
% non-adaptive course taught at your institution, (vi) the specific
% advantages or benefits of partnering with the selected
% vendor/adaptive learning solution to deliver a high quality learning
% experience for students, and,(vii) describe the level of integration
% between the adaptive learning provider and on-campus learning
% infrastructure necessary deliver the course(s).


% b. Please describe the faculty, instructors, instructional
% designers, or organization(s) involved in the selection, design or

% including the role played by the adaptive technology solution and
% provider (max 100 words).

% d. Please describe how adaptive learning aligns with your
