\section{Proposal Narrative}

% Proposal Narrative covering the following topics:

\begin{question}
Please describe the adaptive course(s) to be implemented (max 750
words). We recognize that the course that you have in mind may
already exist but may also be significantly modified or altered in
order to be delivered in a more adaptive mode. The narrative should
provide a detailed description of 
\end{question}
%
% (i) how you intend to deploy adaptive technologies and methodologies
% in the proposed course(s), 
%
% (ii) the course design, pedagogical or learning model that informs
% the course(s), 
%
% (iii) the specific role of instructors and faculty in delivering
% instruction and designing the course(s), 
%
% (iv) the way in which you will assess student learning and mastery
% in the course(s), 
%
% (v) an explanation of how the adaptive course meet or exceeds
% mastery requirements and learning outcomes for a similar
% non-adaptive course taught at your institution, 
%
% (vi) the specific advantages or benefits of partnering with the
% selected vendor/adaptive learning solution to deliver a high quality
% learning experience for students, and,
%
% (vii) describe the level of integration between the adaptive
% learning provider and on-campus learning infrastructure necessary
% deliver the course(s).



% (i) how you intend to deploy adaptive technologies and methodologies
% in the proposed course(s), 

Currently, \mooculus\ is a platform designed for delivering interactive
content to students. In the spring of 2013, we used this platform to
deliver a massive open online calculus course by the same name. The
platform and course material are hosted on Ohio State University
servers and is maintained by a small team of researchers. We will
enhance \mooculus\ with adaptive technology, allowing it to serve as a
supplement for both teaching and learning.

% (ii) the course design, pedagogical or learning model that informs
% the course(s), 

The course will be broken down by topic, and each topic will be recast
as a mini-course. Students wishing to learn a specific topic will be
assessed with a set of diagnostic exercises that will then determine a
curriculum for the student within this mini-course. The curriculum
will consist of online videos, adpative exercises, and selected
textbook readings. This model will facilitate both self-study on the
student's part, and allow teachers to easily integrate our materials
into their courses.

% (iii) the specific role of instructors and faculty in delivering
% instruction and designing the course(s),

The instructors will produce videos, and online assessment
problems. They will work with GratisU to enhance their platform to
produce a usable adaptive course. 


% (iv) the way in which you will assess student learning and mastery
% in the course(s), 

Included with each exercises are a series of hints which will help the
students learn calculus.  Hence to assess the students' performance on
an exercises, we must take into account their use of these hints. We
employ a hidden Markov model to assess the student perfomance in this
case.


% (v) an explanation of how the adaptive course meet or exceeds
% mastery requirements and learning outcomes for a similar
% non-adaptive course taught at your institution, 

We envision assignements without ``hard'' deadlines. The instructor
may suggest that a given assignment is completed at a certain time,
but in fact the students will be able to complete the assignments at
any given time.


% (vi) the specific advantages or benefits of partnering with the
% selected vendor/adaptive learning solution to deliver a high quality
% learning experience for students, and,

GratisU, based in Columbus Ohio, has proved to be resposive and
completetly open in regards to development. This means that if a
faculty memeber has an idea, this idea can be prototyped and deployed
in a matter of days.

% (vii) describe the level of integration between the adaptive
% learning provider and on-campus learning infrastructure necessary
% deliver the course(s).

 In particular, we want
MOOCulus to be

A resource for students who are enrolled in an (unrelated) traditional first
calculus course.

A resource for teachers of a traditional calculus course wishing to ``flip''
their classroom.

A resource for teachers of a traditional calculus course wishing to assign
online skill practice to their students.

To achieve these goals MOOCulus will need to be adaptive in the sense that
seek to understand the students need and deliver.








% b. Please describe the faculty, instructors, instructional
% designers, or organization(s) involved in the selection, design or
% implementation of the adaptive course(s) (max 200 words). Please
% provide relevant background information on how long the organization
% has been in operation, its mission and market penetration and any
% products that are available. Please list the team members, specify
% the activities each person will be involved in, and include any
% recognition for leadership in your field. Please tell us why you
% have confidence that this is the right organization or team to carry
% this work forward and achieve implementation success in this grant
% program.


% c. Short narrative describing a high level work plan with budget
% that details both the course design and implementation process,
% including the role played by the adaptive technology solution and
% provider (max 100 words).

% d. Please describe how adaptive learning aligns with your
% institution’s strategic plan, and if shown to be successful in the
% initial implementation, how will the use of such advanced learning
% solutions be adopted or scaled within your institution (max 100
% words).

% e. Applicants are also requested to provide a 1 page description
% (with budget estimates) of their evaluation approach and the
% detailed metrics that they will monitor and track over the course of
% the project’s lifecycle and during the implementation of these
% courses. The foundation will require all RFP winners to participate
% in evaluation and expects its grantees to plan and work diligently
% to evaluate the efficacy of the selected projects in improving
% intended outcomes related to student success in the course and
% mastery. The foundation expects winners to participate actively with
% the field as part of the program’s learning community, sharing their
% implementation strategies and results as these emerge. Applicants
% are requested to describe their capacity to collect, analyze, and
% share data with others outside the project, for project evaluation
% and in support of secondary research projects or more broader
% dissemination. Please list any limitations you have for sharing data
% and research.

For evaluation, we plan to utilize the expertise of West Monroe
Partners, LLC. The current plan is for the evaluation to be a three-step process:
\paragraph{Evaluation Development} The consultant and project
  manager will partner with the OSU Math Department to develop the
  evaluation.  This activity will take place at the OSU campus.
\paragraph{Usability Assessment} The consultant will conduct the usability
  assessment to complete the evaluation that was developed in the
  first phase.  The project manager will be responsible for reviewing
  the findings and validating any issues discovered in the assessment.
  This assessment will include identified planning and metrics to
  assess the performance of students utilizing the course versus a
  live course.
\paragraph{Preparation of Final Report} Per the grant guidelines, the
  consultant and project manager will develop the final report and
  conform to the format required by OSU.
