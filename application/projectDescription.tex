In the spring of 2013, we developed a massive open online calculus
course. This course, dubed \mooculus, was designed as a stand-alone
first course in calculus.  We will enhance \mooculus with adaptive
technology, allowing it to additionally serve as a supplement for both
the teaching and learning of calculus.
